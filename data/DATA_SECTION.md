## Data

This repository does **not** include the original rainfall data used in this study due to size and distribution constraints.

To reproduce the results, users should provide their **own daily rainfall datasets** in `.xlsx` format and place them in the `data/` directory. The expected structure and preprocessing steps are described in the `shaping/` notebook.

> **Note:** The model assumes daily rainfall input in a tabular format with date and total rainfall columns. Ensure your input follows this format for correct execution.
